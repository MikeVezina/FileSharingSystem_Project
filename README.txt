Roadmap:
	We look to add many features in the upcoming milestones. The features we look to add are listed below.
	- The ability to set names to the producers and consumers (instead of producer0 and consumer0)
	- Custom tags instead of 6 preassigned ones
	- A better payoff strategy
	- Better act strategies 
	- GUI
	- An undo function

No known issues
